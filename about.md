Who is <b>Jerum Hubbert</b>, this site tells the world about me, what I am about.
My site also provides a insight in my theories about business, technology, and the world of technology.
I share my thoughts freely so feel free to quote me if needed.  

I consider myself many things:
* First most a `Father`
* Learner
* Philosopher
* Creator
* Technologist
* Engineer

Quotes to live by:
------

> Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.
> - Hunter S. Thompson

Do the best job you can, technologist should never access the minimum and should strive for the best solution.

> Genius is 1% talent and 99% percent hard work...
> - Albert Einstein

I love this quote because everyone considers Albert Einstein "smart" and a genius. Yet from his own words "smart" and not "smart" are illulsions
there is only training from hard work (99%) and 1% talent. If person is considerd smart or gifted, is this true or has he been trained more then others.
