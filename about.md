Quotes to live by:
------

> Anything worth doing is worth doing right.
> - Hunter S. Thompson

Do the best job you can. Technologists should never aim for the minimum; we should strive for solutions
that are well‑crafted, maintainable, and respectful of the people who depend on them.

> Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.
> - Albert Einstein

I love this quote because everyone considers Albert Einstein “smart” and a genius, yet from his own words
“smart” and “not smart” are illusions. There is training, there is repetition, and there is the 1% spark.
When someone is called “gifted,” is that magic — or is it the compound effect of years of focused effort?
